# WakeMeUp
A simple android kotlin app which allows you to set an alarm and shows you a notification when time is reached.

This app uses a custom Broadcast Receiver for setting repeating alarm at same time everyday and it also uses inbuilt system broadcast intent  
like BOOT_COMPLETED which is called on boot-up.

This app uses SharedPreference to save the set alarm time.

1)Set alarm time by clicking on set alarm
